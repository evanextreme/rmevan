# rm -rf evan

This bot is provided as a service to all potential Discord servers across the world, allowing them to permanently delete every message that I, Evan Hirsh, send. Whenever this bot is added [through this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=532241740774768661&permissions=8192&scope=bot), it will scan every incoming message to see if it is from Evan Hirsh. If it detects that the message is from myself, and it has both the "View Message" and "Manage Messages" permissions in that channel, it will instantly remove the message.

## Why

In the year 2014, a company named Apple decided to do something incredible. They decided to release an album by U2 titled [Songs of Innocence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_Innocence_(U2_album)) and place it in the library of every iTunes user, for free. This was before the age of streaming music services, and was at the time an unprecedented release. However, they did not take into account the users who do not like U2, and wanted the music removed from their library. Because of this, Apple created the [U2 Songs of Innocence Removal Tool](https://buy.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZFinance.woa/wa/offerOptOut) which to this day is seen as a model example of digital rights management.

`-rm rf evan` is the human equivalent of the Songs of Innocence removal tool. Allowing you to quickly and easily remove Evan's future presence from your Discord server.
